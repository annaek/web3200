A business (also known as enterprise or firm)
is an organization engaged in the trade of goods,
services, or both to consumers. Businesses are
predominant in capitalist economies, where
most of them are privately owned and administered
to earn profit to increase the wealth of their owners.
Businesses may also be not-for-profit or state-owned.
A business owned by multiple individuals may be
referred to as a company, although that term
also has a more precise meaning.
