<p>A Deadly Education</p>
<p>Naomi Novik</p>
<p>A Deadly Education is set at Scholomance,
a school for the magically gifted where failure
means certain death (for real) — until one girl,
El, begins to unlock its many secrets.
There are no teachers, no holidays,
and no friendships, save strategic ones.
Survival is more important than any letter
grade, for the school won’t allow its students
to leave until they graduate… or die!
The rules are deceptively simple:
Don’t walk the halls alone.
And beware of the monsters who lurk everywhere.
El is uniquely prepared for the school’s dangers.
She may be without allies, but she possesses
a dark power strong enough to level mountains
and wipe out millions. It would be easy
enough for El to defeat the monsters that
prowl the school. The problem? Her
powerful dark magic might also kill
all the other students.</p>
