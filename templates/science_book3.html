<p>The Overstory</p>
<p>Richard Powers</p>
<p>The Overstory is a sweeping,
impassioned work of activism and
resistance that is also a stunning
evocation of - and paean to -
the natural world. From the roots
to the crown and back to the seeds,
Richard Powers’s twelfth novel unfolds
in concentric rings of interlocking
fables that range from antebellum New York
to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars
of the Pacific Northwest and beyond.
There is a world alongside ours—vast,
slow, interconnected, resourceful,
magnificently inventive, and almost
invisible to us. This is the story of a
handful of people who learn how to see
that world and who are drawn up into
its unfolding catastrophe.</p>
