<p>Mill Town: Reckoning with What Remains</p>
<p>Kerri Arsenault</p>
<p>Kerri Arsenault grew up in the rural
working class town of Mexico, Maine.
For over 100 years the community orbited
around a paper mill that employs most townspeople,
including three generations of Arsenault’s own family.
Years after she moved away, Arsenault realized the
price she paid for her seemingly secure childhood.
The mill, while providing livelihoods for nearly
everyone, also contributed to the destruction of
the environment and the decline of the town’s
economic, physical, and emotional health in a
slow-moving catastrophe, earning the area the
nickname “Cancer Valley. ”Mill Town is an
personal investigation, where Arsenault
sifts through historical archives and
scientific reports, talks to family and
neighbors, and examines her own childhood
to illuminate the rise and collapse of
the working-class, the hazards of loving
and leaving home, and the ambiguous nature
of toxics and disease. Mill Town is a moral
wake-up call that asks, Whose lives are we
willing to sacrifice for our own survival?</p>
